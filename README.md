A basic implementation of combinational logic working mechanism mostly seen in Digital Locks like safes and bank vaults. The password for the safe is a four-digit binary number,
which is set as a parameter. The combination is entered as a binary number; until and unless the combination matches the password, the safe remains in Lock state. When you enter the 
correct combination of 0's and 1's , the safe Unlocks.

**Study of an example case :**


When 0111, 0101, 1011 are entered; since the combinations are wrong, the seven segment display is showing Locked and when 1010 is entered, the seven segment display is showing Unlocked.
